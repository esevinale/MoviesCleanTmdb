It aired Sundays at 9 P.M. Eastern\/8 P.M. Central, on ABC from October 3, 2004, until May 13, 2012. Executive producer Cherry served as showrunner. Other executive producers since the fourth season included Bob Daily, George W. Perkins, John Pardee, Joey Murphy, David Grossman, and Larry Shaw.\n\nThe main setting of the show was Wisteria Lane, a street in the fictional American town of 'Fairview' in the fictional 'Eagle State'.

The storyline covers thirteen years of the women's lives over eight seasons, set between the years 2004–2008, and later 2013–2017. They worked through domestic struggles and family life, while facing the secrets, crimes and mysteries hidden behind the doors of their — at the surface — beautiful and seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood.\n\nThe show featured an ensemble cast, headed by Teri Hatcher as Susan Mayer, Felicity Huffman as Lynette Scavo, Marcia Cross as Bree Van de Kamp, and Eva Longoria as Gabrielle Solis. Brenda Strong narrated the show as the deceased Mary Alice Young, appearing sporadically in flashbacks or dream sequences.","origin_country":["US"]}],"adult":false},{"popularity":1.001361,"id":1671189,"profile_path":"\/fwIZJ66JICPJYa45Q9996OT2YOv.jpg","name":"Sam","known_for":[{"original_name":"Dieux de la scène","id":65257,"media_type":"tv","name":"Dieux de la scène","vote_count":0,"vote_average":0,"poster_path":null,"first_air_date":"2014-08-26","popularity":1.108365,"genre_ids":[99,10764],"original_language":"fr","backdrop_path":"\/bKgA4nuTud5nlQjNqOVglZxPv6G.jpg","overview":"Takes the viewers behind the scenes of the most prestigious male strip club for women in Canada.","origin_country":["CA"]}],"adult":false},{"popularity":1.00024,"id":1747792,"profile_path":null,"name":"Sam","known_for":[],"adult":false},{"popularity":1.00011,"id":2037205,"profile_path":null,"name":"Sam","known_for":[{"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"id":522567,"video":false,"media_type":"movie","title":"Vettai Karuppar Ayya","popularity":1.17239,"poster_path":"\/n5haBtK34DEE52owendIE3GP5ia.jpg","original_language":"ta","original_title":"Vettai Karuppar Ayya","genre_ids":[27],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"This story revolves around Tamil and Srgnt.
